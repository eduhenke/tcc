\chapter{Conclusion}

In this work we presented a dependently-typed programming language, with a type-checker and a parser, written in Haskell. The language is based on the lambda calculus, and has a simple syntax, with a type system that supports dependent types. The language is not intended to be used in production, but rather as a proof-of-concept of a dependently-typed programming language, and as a way to learn more about dependently-typed programming languages. We believe that the language is simple enough to be used as a starting point for someone interested in learning about dependently-typed programming languages. The language can be found at \url{https://github.com/eduhenke/dep-tt}.
